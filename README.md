## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I mainly use my GitHub account to host some of the more refined projects and scientific works from my computer science studies. My latest projects include:
- ðŸ¤– [Campus-Plan-Bot](https://github.com/thomasmarwitz/campus_plan_bot): a user-friendly chatbot that helps people navigate the KIT campus. It uses a RAG-based natural language interface and was developed in collaboration with [@thomasmarwitz](https://github.com/thomasmarwitz)
- ðŸ§­ Systematization of knowledge [paper](https://github.com/LunaNordin/Mechanistic-Interpretability-of-Large-Language-Models) giving an overview of mechanistic interpretability techniques for LLMs
- ðŸŽ² A [quantitative analysis](https://github.com/LunaNordin/Efficient-Probabilistic-Inference-with-Orthogonal-Tensor-Train-Decomposition) of inference in hidden Markov models represented by tensor networks

I also work as a voluntary frontend developer at [KleineTat](https://www.kleinetat.com/), helping to create a sharing app that makes sharing easy and unique
